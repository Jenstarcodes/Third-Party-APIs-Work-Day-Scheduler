## Description
For this challenge the goal was to create a simple daily scheduler that enables the user to input and save hourly events throughout the day. The daily scheduler app should run in the web browser and include dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JQuery. Please note this challenge utilized starter code which used the Moment.JS library to work with dates and times. However, direction was also given to freely use a different JavaScript solution as an alternate which is the path I chose.  

### Technologies
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## User Story
AS AN employee with a busy schedule I WANT to add important events to a daily planner SO THAT I can manage my time effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Creation of a daily planner to create a schedule.
- When the planner is opened then the current day is deployed at the top of the planner.
- When the user scrolls down the page then the user is presented with time blocks for standard business hours.
- When the user views the time blocks for that day then each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future.
- When user clicks into a time block then an event can be entered.
- When the save button is clicked for that time block then the text for that event is saved to local storage.
- When the page is refreshed the saved event should persist.
